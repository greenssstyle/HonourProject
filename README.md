Geling Hu's Honour Project(University of Ottawa)

This contains the entire Android Studio project which is VoiceAssistant.

  The reason why I am choosing speech recognition is that in the Artificial Intelligence field, one of the main points is to allow interaction between systems and human. Under this circumstance, speech-to-text (speech recognition) is the first step for systems to understand what command is given by people. Many big firms such as Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Baidu already started their research on speech recognition for many years and some of the companies have released their API for engineers to further develop in field of speech recognition.

  I implemented six main features in total â€“ Read Messages, Send Messages, Make Phone Calls, Open Other Applications, Search on Internet, and Chatbot.
